Minesweeper
===========

I built the game Minesweeper in Java, partly to play on my own, but also to try and create an algorithm that will solve Minesweeper. Right now, I'm working on the solving algorithm in Python and I might right it in Java at some point.
The game is fully playable, but there's no GUI option to change the width, height, number of mines, or to restart a game.I doubt I'll add that in the future.
